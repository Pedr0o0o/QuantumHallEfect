# QuantumHallEfect

The project analyzes the quantization of Hall conductivity in the so-called Hall bar structure. 
Using Quantum which is a free (open source) Python package for numerical computation

This effect is a clear symptom of the formation of quantized Landau levels for electrons in the presence of an external magnetic field and the appearance of the so-called shore state.
